# mp3 Scraper

One day, I wanted to download all of John Piper's sermons on Romans so that I can listen to them in my car.
It turns out that there are a LOT of them.
See https://www.desiringgod.org/series/romans-the-greatest-letter-ever-written'

I quickly got tired of downloading the `mp3`s one by one, so I wrote this.
I have not tested this on any other URL than the one above.

Feel free to adapt this to download your favourite sermons.
